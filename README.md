# ghettoTD



### 1.What does ghettoTD do?
This project was created as a part of a Uni programming course, with the main goal of learning how to put together software of around 500 lines
with reasonable object-oriented design.

### How to "play":

It is a simple sandbox-ish Tower Defense type game where you have enemies swarming towards a certain location following the fastest path.
Your goal is to build Towers in a way that creates enough time for the towers to shoot the enemies down.
You are awarded money for each kill which you can buy towers with.

Inherent part of the game is the inability to sell a tower or block-off (try it, they just pass through) enemies from reaching the finish tile.
It's DEFINETELY not an unfinished functionality that might be added later but a FEATURE.




#### Controls

x                 : builds a tower


Right mouse click : selects a tile where the tower will be built
