# ghettoTD



### 1.What does ghettoTD do?
This project was created as a part of a Uni programming course, with the main goal of learning how to put together software of around 500 lines
with reasonable object-oriented design.

It is a simple sandbox-ish Tower Defense type game where you have enemies swarming towards a certain location following the fastest path.
Your goal is to build Towers in a way that creates enough time for the towers to shoot the enemies down.
You are awarded money for each kill which you can buy towers with.
